# Tree_of_Knowledge
Tree of Knowledge is a hackathon project and an experiment in using a tree data structure to visually organize information on a topic. The intention was to make a more intuitive way to view a subject and how it relates to other subjects.  This could be used by an individual user to organize resources they find useful (perhaps to study for an exam), it could be a site with links curated by experts or a wikipedia style contribution system, or perhaps it could be used with machine learning algorithms in conjunction with sites like wikipedia and google in order to automatically generate these trees.
